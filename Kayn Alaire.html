<container class="p1">
  <p id="tribute-info"><em>Physical Description</em> <br> Kayn pocesses a scar on the left side of his face, a face that is rarely seen smiling. He has light ash blonde hair and his skin is of cream complexion. Most notable are his grey eyes. <p>
    <br>
<p>He's snarky, sarcastic and has a big ego. Often he comes off as very cold to those who don't know him but surprisingly growing closer to him relieves quite a considerate person, if you overlook his possessiveness. His stuborn nature results in quite a lot of dishonesty when it comes to his feelings. Tread carefully, if you values your life, getting on an assassin such as himself bad side isn't the best of ideas.</p> <container>

    <container class="list1">
  <ul class="list1-1">
    <li>Kayn was born to Hanna Alarie and Felix Alarie on July 25 1998 followed by his siter Violet Alarie who was born 4 years afterwards. He seemingly had quite the normal childhood, developing like most kids. Unfortunately at the ripe age of seven, the death of his parents sent him down an insufferable path. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Kayn found himself taking up residence at his Grandmother's. Though due to her age, kayn soon learnt from then on he'd have to bare the burden of responsibility, caring for both his sister and his grandmother. Although this may have resulted with much more work on his hands than he was accustom to, the comfort of a shelter and daily meals was a privilege he'd soon learn he was truly grateful for. </li>
       <br>
    <li>Unbeknownst to them, their grandmother was quietly suffering from a fatal disease, and soon enough, she succumbed to her ailments. Once again, Kayn and his sister were on their own, moving from place to place, trying to survive. In his desperation to provide and keep his sister safe, Kayn began involving himself with the wrong set of people, doing their dirty work in exchange for food and money. This is where he got his start: stealing and killing to survive.</li>
       <br>
    <li>As the years went on, he grew and with his growth his skills as an assassin improved subnational. He solidified himself as a noteworthy adversary and a skilled killer. Due to the nature of his job, he had also grown cold. His hands were stained with blood... but it wasn't anything he couldn't just wash off with some soap and water.</li>
       <br>
         <li>Today, he's less active than before. Many speculate he has settled down and started a family of some sort. Others believe he's gone under an alias and is working in secret to live a more secluded life. Nevertheless no one truly knows but him. Despite his decreased activity, his services are still available!</li>
